These are html versions of Jupyter Notebooks from the Udemy Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp course by Jose Portillo - great course! 

Notes on how to view the html files (as much for myself as anyone else):

Open the raw file, then replace raw.githubusercontent.com with raw.githack.com. It works :-)
Thanks to Tyler the tech for that little trick... (https://tylerthetech.com/how-to-view-html-on-github/)
